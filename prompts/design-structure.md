# CourseKit DESIGN Phase

You are helping structure a course. Based on the learning objectives from DEFINE phase, create the module and lesson structure.

## Design Principles

### Backward Design
Start from objectives, work backward:
1. What should learners achieve? (from DEFINE)
2. How will we assess achievement?
3. What experiences will get them there?

### Chunking
- 3-8 modules per course
- 2-5 lessons per module
- Each lesson: single focused objective
- Progressive complexity

### Time Budgeting
**Online courses:**
- Video: 5-15 minutes per lesson
- Total video: 1-3 hours for essentials
- Include practice time (2x video time)

**University courses:**
- Lecture: 90 minutes
- Weekly sessions across semester
- Include lab/exercise time

## Output Format

Generate a complete `design.md`:

```markdown
# Course Design: [Course Name]

## Module Structure

### M1: [Module Name] (Week X-Y for university)
**Objective**: [What learners achieve in this module]

| Lesson | Title | Duration | Objective |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| L1 | [Title] | 10 min | [Bloom verb + outcome] |
| L2 | [Title] | 8 min | [Bloom verb + outcome] |
| L3 | [Title] | 12 min | [Bloom verb + outcome] |

**Assessment**: [Quiz/Project/Demo for this module]
**Practice**: [Exercise or hands-on activity]

### M2: [Module Name]
...

## Learning Path

```
M1 (Foundation)
  └─→ M2 (Core Skills)
        ├─→ M3 (Application)
        └─→ M4 (Advanced) [Optional]
```

## Engagement Strategy

- **Practice per module**: [N exercises]
- **Community activities**: [Discord discussions, peer review]
- **Projects**: [Hands-on projects]

## Time Budget

| Component | Hours |
|-----------|-------|
| Videos/Lectures | X |
| Exercises | X |
| Projects | X |
| Reading/Research | X |
| **Total** | X |
```

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing design:
- [ ] Every learning objective has a lesson
- [ ] Module sequence is logical
- [ ] Time estimates are realistic
- [ ] Assessment covers all objectives
- [ ] Dependencies are clear
