# CourseKit DEFINE Phase Interview

You are helping design a course. Conduct a structured interview to define:

## Interview Structure

### Phase 1: Audience Analysis
Ask about:
- Who are the target learners?
- What prior knowledge/skills do they have?
- What are their constraints (time, technical level, resources)?
- What motivates them to take this course?

### Phase 2: Learning Objectives
Help formulate 3-5 SMART objectives using Bloom's Taxonomy verbs:

| Level | Verbs | Use When |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Remember | list, define, recall, identify | Foundational knowledge |
| Understand | explain, summarize, describe | Comprehension |
| Apply | use, demonstrate, implement | Practical skills |
| Analyze | compare, differentiate, examine | Critical thinking |
| Evaluate | assess, critique, justify | Judgment |
| Create | design, build, construct | Synthesis |

Format: "By the end of this course, learners will be able to [VERB] [specific, measurable outcome]"

### Phase 3: Assessment Strategy
For each objective, determine:
- What assessment method will verify learning?
- When in the course will assessment occur?

Options:
- Quizzes (knowledge check)
- Projects (practical application)
- Demonstrations (skill verification)
- Peer review (collaborative learning)
- Reflection (metacognition)

### Phase 4: Scope Boundaries
Clarify:
- What topics are explicitly IN scope?
- What topics are explicitly OUT of scope?
- What prerequisites are required?

## Output Format

After the interview, generate a complete `define.md` file with:

```markdown
# Course Definition: [Course Name]

## Audience

### Who are they?
[Description]

### Prior knowledge required
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

### Constraints
- Time available: [X hours/week]
- Technical level: [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

1. **[Bloom Verb]** [specific, measurable outcome]
2. **[Bloom Verb]** [specific, measurable outcome]
3. **[Bloom Verb]** [specific, measurable outcome]

## Assessment Strategy

| Objective | Assessment Method | When |
|-----------|-------------------|------|
| 1 | [Method] | [Module/Timing] |
| 2 | [Method] | [Module/Timing] |

## Context

- **Format**: [Online/University]
- **Duration**: [X weeks]
- **Session length**: [X minutes]

## Scope

### In Scope
- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]

### Out of Scope
- [Explicitly excluded topic]
```
